/*
 * Integers 'i31'
 * --------------
 *
 * The 'i31' functions implement computations on big integers using
 * an internal representation as an array of 32-bit integers. For
 * an array x[]:
 *  -- x[0] encodes the array length and the "announced bit length"
 *     of the integer: namely, if the announced bit length is k,
 *     then x[0] = ((k / 31) << 5) + (k % 31).
 *  -- x[1], x[2]... contain the value in little-endian order, 31
 *     bits per word (x[1] contains the least significant 31 bits).
 *     The upper bit of each word is 0.
 *
 * Multiplications rely on the elementary 32x32->64 multiplication.
 *
 * The announced bit length specifies the number of bits that are
 * significant in the subsequent 32-bit words. Unused bits in the
 * last (most significant) word are set to 0; subsequent words are
 * uninitialized and need not exist at all.
 *
 * The execution time and memory access patterns of all computations
 * depend on the announced bit length, but not on the actual word
 * values. For modular integers, the announced bit length of any integer
 * modulo n is equal to the actual bit length of n; thus, computations
 * on modular integers are "constant-time" (only the modulus length may
 * leak).

 * Implementation notes:
 * =====================
 *
 * The uintN_t types are unsigned and with width exactly N bits; the C
 * standard guarantees that computations are performed modulo 2^N, and
 * there can be no overflow. Negation (unary '-') works on unsigned types
 * as well.
 *
 * The intN_t types are guaranteed to have width exactly N bits, with no
 * padding bit, and using two's complement representation. Casting
 * intN_t to uintN_t really is conversion modulo 2^N. Beware that intN_t
 * types, being signed, trigger implementation-defined behaviour on
 * overflow (including raising some signal): with GCC, while modular
 * arithmetics are usually applied, the optimizer may assume that
 * overflows don't occur (unless the -fwrapv command-line option is
 * added); Clang has the additional -ftrapv option to explicitly trap on
 * integer overflow or underflow.
